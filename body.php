<p>Ms. Betancourt,</p>
<p>I am Jessie Bregenzer with Old Mountain Law. This e-mail is being written as a courtesy notice of impending legal action against your son, Cristiano Giovanni Betancourt, who will hereafter be referred to as Mr. Betancourt.</p>

<p>On December 31st, 2022, Mr. Betancourt is believed to have spearheaded a fear campaign against his ex-girlfriend, who will hereafter be referred to as my client. Mr. Betancourt led my client to believe that he had seriously harmed himself due to a romantic separation from my client. This fear campaign comprised of text messages from a fake number, fradulent notices of admittance to a hospital, and guilt tripping of my client for being the sole reason.</p>

<p>On January 12th, 2023, Mr. Betancourt is believed to have spearheaded a second fear campagin against my client. Mr. Betancourt led my client to believe he had taken his own life due to a romantic separation from my client. This fear campaign comprised of text messages from a fake number, a video recording of him supposedly hanging himself in the woods, a series of video monologues directed at my client, and a long text document blaming my client as being the sole reason.</p>

<p>The legitimacy of the acts on January 12th, 2023 are still under investigation. The incident has been reported to law enforcement and we are waiting on verification. If it is found that this was another fear campaign and Mr. Betancourt is alive and well, legal action will be to follow. These acts are harassment and defamatory. Your son appears to be unstable. It is recommended that you reach out to your son, and subsequently law enforcement agencies, to follow up on this matter. It is also strongly recommended that you reply to this e-mail with any information you have regarding the last time you heard from your son or reach out to us by phone at our office number and hours below. We are open to allowing you to speak to our client to expedite the investigation or de-escalate this issue.</p>
